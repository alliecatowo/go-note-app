# Go Note App

This is an educational project to demonstrate the use of Go in a simple note-taking application.

## Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `main.go`: This is the entry point of the application. It handles user input and interacts with the `note` package to create and display notes.
- `note/note.go`: This file defines the `Note` struct and its associated methods for displaying and saving notes.

## Usage

To run the application, use the following command:

```sh
go run main.go
```

This will prompt you to enter a title and content for a new note. The note will then be displayed and saved.
